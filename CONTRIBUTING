# Contributing to MusicEngine
## Idea Ownership & Code Assignment Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **MusicEngine** 🎶  
MusicEngine is built on creativity, experimentation, and collaboration.

To keep the project legally clear while respecting contributors,  
the following rules apply to **all contributions**.

By contributing, you agree to this agreement.

---

## 1. Ideas & Concepts

All **ideas, concepts, suggestions, feature proposals, and discussions**
(shared via issues, discussions, chats, or comments):

- remain the intellectual property of the contributor,
- are **not automatically owned** by MusicEngine,
- may be reused by the contributor in other projects.

Submitting an idea alone does **not** transfer ownership.

---

## 2. Code & Implementations

All **code and technical implementations** that are:

- submitted as pull requests,
- committed to this repository,
- merged into MusicEngine,

become the **exclusive property of MusicEngine**.

This includes:
- source code
- scripts
- engine modules
- internal tools
- documentation directly tied to code behavior

By submitting code, you **assign all copyrights** of that code to MusicEngine.

---

## 3. Separation of Idea and Code

An idea does **not** become owned by MusicEngine until it is:

- implemented in code, **and**
- submitted to this repository.

Only the **actual written code** is assigned —  
the underlying idea remains yours.

---

## 4. Moral Rights & Modification

Where applicable by law, contributors agree to:

- waive or not assert moral rights related to contributed code,
- allow MusicEngine to modify, rewrite, relicense, or restructure the code
  without restriction.

---

## 5. License Back to Contributors

Unless explicitly stated, contributors do **not** receive an automatic license
to reuse contributed code outside of MusicEngine.

Reuse requires explicit permission from the MusicEngine maintainer.

---

## 6. Project Control & Future

MusicEngine retains full control over:
- project direction,
- licensing and relicensing,
- commercial and non-commercial use,
- future foundation, organization, or company structures.

This applies regardless of project size or success.

---

## 7. Community & Opportunities

MusicEngine values contributors who are:
- respectful,
- kind,
- creative,
- collaborative.

If the project grows, contributors who wish to may:
- be publicly credited,

- be considered for paid roles or positions.

No obligation, no guarantee.

---
